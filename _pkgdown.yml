- title: Bloodmeal
  desc: >
    The bloodmeal function computes bites taken by mosquitoes on hosts relevant
    for pathogen transmission between species over a time step. After it is computed, the various
    components can be updated independently.

- title: Adult mosquito component

  desc: >
    The adult mosquito component is responsible for updating mosquito populations
    of the adult (flying) life stage, and handling pathogen dynamics in adult
    populations. Any model of adult mosquitoes in MicroMoB is required to
    implement the following interface methods.

- title: Aquatic (immature) mosquito component

  desc: >
    The aquatic mosquito component is responsible for updating aquatic mosquito
    populations which live in aquatic habitats. It must calculate how many eggs
    are oviposited by adults per day, add them to aquatic habitats, update the aquatic life stages, and calculate
    the number of emerging adults. Any model of immature mosquitoes in MicroMoB is required to
    implement the following interface methods.

- subtitle: Trace (forced) aquatic model
  desc: >
    This is a model of aquatic mosquitoes where emergence is passed as a trace (forcing)
    term and it is not affected by endogenous dynamics.
