## MicroMoB 0.0.9

This is a resubmission which addresses previous requests from CRAN. Specifically:

  * all exported functions now include the section \value to the docs giving the
  return value of the function
  * all vignettes now reset the graphical parameters `par` to default values after
  being used.

Please note that there is no additional reference describing the methods in this
package.
