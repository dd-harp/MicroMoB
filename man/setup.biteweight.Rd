\title{Setup a time spent model}
\usage{
setup.biteweight(type, model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{a character in \code{c("null")}}

\item{model}{a model object (an \link{environment})}

\item{...}{other arguments to be passed to type methods}
}
\description{
Setup a time spent model. The model object must have already
been initialized with a human object (see \link{setup.human}). This adds
a \link{list} to \code{model} named "tisp" (Time spent).
}
\section{Matrix time spent model}{

When using \code{type = "matrix_day"} the model will assume that \code{theta} is a
matrix whose rows sum to \eqn{\le 1} giving the daily time spent distribution
