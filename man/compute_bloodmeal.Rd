\description{
This should be run prior to any \code{step} functions to update
components over a time step. It computes various quantities related to
disease transmission between species using the generic interfaces (methods)
provided by each component. It updates the \code{EIR} vector for the human component, and \code{kappa}, the net infectiousness
of hosts for the mosquito component.
