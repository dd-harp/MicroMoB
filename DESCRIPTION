Description: MicroMoB provides a framework based on S3 dispatch for constructing models
  of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission which are constructed from submodels of various
  components (i.e. immature and adult mosquitoes, human populations). A consistent mathematical
  expression for the distribution of bites on hosts means that different models
  (stochastic, deterministic, etc.) can be coherently incorporated and updated
  over a discrete time step.
